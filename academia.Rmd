Welcome to **Appalachian State University**, home of the infamous Mountaineer football (i.e. we beat Michigan University that one time in '07 *booyah*), mountain ranges, and free spirits. 

I am graduating in December of 2017 and ready to kickstart my career.

I've been studying Psychology with a concentration in Business. I also have minors in Statistics, Labor Relations, and Human Resource Management. 

I intend to pursue a graduate level degree in **Industrial-Organizational Pyschology.**

  If you are unfamiliar with I/O Psychology - it is essentially the interaction of the workplace and the application of psychological principles. As an I/O Psychologist, I seek to better the work environment for the employees, as well as come up with solutions in relation to the longevity and profitability of the business itself. 
  
  I think this is important because half of your functioning hours on any given workday are spent at the job; so shouldn't it be more enjoyable??? :-)
